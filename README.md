My first project in Introduction to computing. 

The program draws a picture of a few boxes inside of one another. 
Then the smallest box is separated into quadrants. Quadrants 2 and 4 are blue, while quadrants 1 and 3 are green. 
Next, a border of triangles, randomly colored, surrounds the outer box.
